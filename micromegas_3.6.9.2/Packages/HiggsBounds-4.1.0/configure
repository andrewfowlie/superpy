# --- variables defined by configure ---
# If you want to edit these variables, change ./configure, not ./makefile


#----------------------------

# Put you favourite compiler and compiler options in here:

# e.g.

#  a) GNU compiler (http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortran): 
F90C = gfortran
F77C = gfortran
F90FLAGS = -fbounds-check -ffixed-line-length-none
# use the compiler flag -fopenmp for parallel processing

#  b) g95 compiler (www.g95.org):
#F90C = g95
#F77C = g95
#F90FLAGS = -fbounds-check -ffree-line-length-huge

#  c)  Portland Group Inc. compiler: 
#F90C = pgf90
#F77C = pgf90
#F90FLAGS = -C -Ktrap=fp -Mbounds

#  d) Intel compiler:
#F90C = ifort
#F77C = ifort
#F90FLAGS =  

#if using the NAG compiler, you need the compiler flag -DNAGf90Fortran
#because the subroutines flush,iargc,getarg need to use modules
#caution: the use of the NAG compiler is unsupported)

#(nb. the f77 compiler is currently only used for compiling the example programs)

#------------------------------

# If you wish to use HiggsBounds in conjunction with FeynHiggs or CPsuperH,
# make sure these paths indicate where you've stored these packages on your system,

# for example:

FHINCLUDE = -I/blah/blah/FeynHiggs-2.x.x/i586-linux/include
FHLIBS = -L/blah/blah/FeynHiggs-2.x.x/i586-linux/lib -lFH

CPSUPERHLIBS = -L/blah/blah/CPsuperH2 -lcpsuperh2 

# Note that care must be taken to ensure that consistent compilers are used
# If you get error messages similar to 
#   ... undefined reference to initialize_higgsbounds__...
# and the paths the libraries are correct, it's a good idea to check 
# that the same compilers are used for each package.
# (you may be able to work around this 
#   e.g. if FeynHiggs was compiled with g77 it may be possible to compile HiggsBounds
#  with gfortran and add -lg2c to the end of the variable FHLIBS)

#-----------------------------

HBLIBS = -L./ -lHB

EXE = HiggsBounds

#-----------------------------

#USECHISQMODS = \$(CHISQMODS)
#ADDITIONALDEFINE = -DenableCHISQ

# --- end defs by configure ---
