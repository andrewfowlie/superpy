#0.129: Captured err=123 (when cs or w = 0).
#0.128: Commented out code to check whether a job was prematurely
#         killed.  It is causing more headaches than it is helping
#         right now.  Perhaps I will come back to it later.

#0.119: Slightly improved show_distr command.
#0.118: Replaced | wc -l with length(split("\n", when determining
#         if a job is still running.  Also, only check after 
#         certain time.
#0.117: Added code designed to print message and quit if some jobs
#         are killed prematurely (for example by the pbs cluster).
#0.116: Removed run_vegas and use my own n_calchep -blind command.
#       Set the minimum values nSess=5 and nCalls=10000.
#0.115: Added missing -e in if statement.
#0.114: Changed redirection operator from &> (which was having
#         trouble on Ubunut 11.10 to 2>&1 1> which appears to work.

#         where event generation was slightly changed.
#0.110: Rewrote how the number of events in each subprocess is
#         determined.  It now starts with the expectation value
#         for each subprocess, N.  If N<10 then it sets N=10.
#         It then sets N=N+5*sqrt(N) to include the possibility
#         of a fluctuation of 5 Gaussian sigmas in the number 
#         of events in each channel.
#0.109: Removed "PDG" from LHAPDF line.
#       Fixed #Vegas_calls and #Events line of session.dat.
#         Someone had removed the user input from these lines.
#       Fixed bug that looked for CH Error in the wrong file.
#0.108: Commented out various lines linking autoprot.h
#         and EXTLIB which are not used anymore.
#       Fixed Vegas calls line to update with new
#         version of CalcHEP.
#       Removed make_VandP_old since it is no longer
#         needed.
#       Changed the order of writing the md5sums
#         for the model and compiling VandP.  This 
#         should fix the bug Sasha Pukhov found.
#       Changed the requested number of events to 1.2
#         times the nominal number since event_mixer
#         was running out too frequently after 
#         event_mixer was fixed to not go back to the
#         start of the file.
#0.107: Changed lhapdf input to what is inside the 
#         quotes.
#       Set cleanup to False by default.
#       Changed Error to CH Error.
#         Also print error message to stdout.
#0.106: Updated the final number of events to work
#         with new version of CalcHEP.(Pukhov)
#0.105: Replaced link to job.o to job.out.
#       Catch event_mixer error.
#0.104: Removed incorrect \. (Pukhov)
#0.103: Switched gnuplot plots to differential cs.
#0.102: Updated blind command to work with new
#         version of CH. (Pukhov)
#0.101: Remove html/mN if model changes.
#       Compile VandP.so every time in case
#         the user external libs changed.
#0.100: Check funcLocal if funcX.mdl changes.
#       Added WORK:= to VandP makefile.
#       Added -V option to PBS and LSF clusters.
#0.99 : Improved VandP generation.
#       Generate list of processes in Processes/mX.
#         Users session in WORK is not affected now.
#       Regenerates VandP.so if model changed.
#       Regenerates all codes if prtclesX.mdl or 
#         lgrngX.mdl changed.
#       Removed symbolic tmp dir and results/*.a
#         during symbolic job if Cleanup=True.
#       Redirect all output to job.o and cs.o.
#         No longer rely on cluster redirection.
#0.98 : Removed code that removed model directories if 
#         not in models.txt.  Added line to models.txt
#         if present model is not included.
#       Added VandP.so to Processes/mX and linked it to
#         n_calchep codes.  If VandP.so is removed, it
#         will be recreated without recreating n_calchep.
#         This should enable changes to varsX.mdl and
#         extlibX.mdl.  Thanks to Sasha Pukhov for help
#         with this.
#0.97 : If CALCHEP evironment variable is not set, exit.
#       Removed Model Changed from html help files.
#         It is no longer needed so not advertised.        
#       Switched signal of succesful completion of
#         symbolic job to presence of n_calchep.
#       When premature termination occurs, a nonzero
#         integer signal is returned.  See 
#         kill_all_jobs for definition of signals.
#       Thoroughly rewrote the cleanup code.
#         Now, it removes everything that is not 
#         reused.
#0.96 : Changed full path symbolic links to relative
#         links for results directory binaries.
#0.95 : Added kill_all_jobs that is used if the user
#         kills batch script or if a job has
#         an error.
#       Removed allDec! for widths.
#         Now use one of the other processes for 
#         widths.
#0.94 : Write finished file at the end of a job to
#         signal the end of a job.
#       Watch for nonzero return value of CH programs.
#         Write error to file if nonzero.
#0.93 : Added the -f option to the remove command.
#0.92 : Added SLURM commands.  Needs to be tested.
#       Fixed pid for local jobs.
#0.91 : Updated to work with new version of CH according
#         to Sasha Pukhov and Sasha Belyaev's suggestions.
#0.90 : Fixed a problem where n_calchep produced an 
#         infinite number of events when the partial
#         width was zero.
#0.89 : Replaced $line =~ s/q($param)/$dist_param[$k]/g;
#         with $param =~ s/([.+*?])/\\$1/g;
#         $line =~ s/$param/$dist_param[$k]/g;
#	 Other characters can be added to escape if
#         necessary.
#0.88 : Replaced $line =~ s/$param/$dist_param[$k]/g;
#         with $line =~ s/q($param)/$dist_param[$k]/g;
#	 to cause $param to be interpreted literally.
#0.87 : Added Remove to the copy of the batch
#         file included in the lhe file.
#0.86 : Fixed bug where gnuplot instructions 
#         didn't work when a variable in 
#         vars.mdl began with * such as in 
#         the case of *slhaON.
#0.85 : Fixed bug where distributions aren't 
#         plotted when only 1 subprocess is
#         done.
#0.84 : Fixed bug where help dir was not being
#         created when no batch file was present.
#0.83 : Fixed bugs in LSF mode.  
#         Thanks to Riccardo Torre.
#0.82 : Fixed regexp for cs.o.  Thanks to Riccardo
#         Torre for finding the bug.
#0.81 : Added removal of particles.
#       Added warning to help files about checking
#         the prt_1 files.
#0.80 : Fixed a few stupid bugs with 0.78.

#0.79 : Added html directory to batch file.
#         Thanks to Riccardo Torre!
#0.78 : Added LSF cluster ability.
#         Thanks to Riccardo Torre!
#0.77 : Fixed bug in kinematics renumbering.
#       Also added kinematics feature for decays
#         in response to Can Kilic's request.
#         He was doing a 1->4 decay.
#0.76 : Added cut inverse option.
#0.75 : Set luminosity to 1E+50 so that it won't run
#         short when very small cross sections are 
#         encountered.
#       Fixed small bug in decay and width session.dat
#         that wrote physical parameters twice.
#0.74 : Fixed some typos in html help files.
#0.73 : Fixed bug in distributions where 
#         it was trying to link to decay
#         distributions.
#       Fixed bug with 3*x in processes.
#0.72 : Fixed link to CalcHEP.
#0.71 : Finished first draft of help files.
#       Added link to CalcHEP.
#       Added empty link to future paper.
#       Added model name to html progress reports.
#       Updated warning messages.
#0.70 : Fixed bug with distribution in the following
#         example: p,p->l,l with dist M(l,l) which
#         gave M(E,E), M(E,e) and M(e,e).  Now it
#         only gives M(E,e). 
#       Added more material to help files.
#0.69 : Moved feature requests to google group page.
#       Rewrote the instructions in README.
#       Edited calchep_batch shell script.
#0.68 : Changed to full path to html/index.html in
#         message printed to shell.
#0.67 : Fixed bug where filename was not being printed
#         in run_details.
#0.66 : Changed cp to mv for final event file since 
#         apparently some people produce event files 
#         which are too big to have two copies on the
#         same disk.
#0.65 : Changed allNew to allDec to include all decays.
#       Changed cat to cp for final event file since
#         run_details is included by event_mixer now.
#0.64 : Changed from model number to model name.
#       Fixed pbs mem bug ", mem"->" -l mem".
#       Fixed N events in html/runs/single.txt.
#       Fixed distribution bug where bin size of
#       2/100 didn't work properly.  Replaced it
#         with 2/100.0.
#       Fixed QCD scale.  It now allows both MZ/2
#         and M34 (for example).
#       If cleanup is set to true, Events/tmp is 
#         also cleaned up.
#       Added minor tics to gnuplot distributions.
#0.63 : Updated to use new version of event_mixer.
#       Removed plain format.
#       Changed name from calchep_batch back to run_batch.
#       Added ntuple option.
#       Read url from extlib and add it to lsh header.
#       Added model name to lsh header.
#       Removed # from batch details in lsh header.
#       Added email to PBS instructions.
#0.62 : Added memory specification for pbs job script.
#0.61 : Added output for CH errors.  Set to exit if CH error
#         encountered.
#       Started help files.
#       Set default CH_PATH to working dir (if shell variable
#         CALCHEP is not set.)
#0.60 : Finished update to use s_calchep rather than calchep.
#0.59 : Updated the batch details in event file.
#       Only print pdf info relevant to pdf.
#0.58 : Fixed the cuts and distributions so that if they have more
#         than 2 parameters, duplicate parameters are allowed
#         if there are the same number or more duplicates
#         in the process.  This finishes the fix begun in 
#         v0.52.
#0.57 : Changed to read batch file name as argument without flag.
#       The shell script in user directory needs to be updated.
#       Changed to use calchep environment variable for bin
#         directory location.
#0.56 : Changed the name to calchep_batch.
#0.55 : Added text output when batch file is not found.
#       Added text output specifying where to find progress
#         and Events.
#       Made change so events are generated without recalculating
#         the cross section.
#       Modified the progress reports to split production, decays
#         and widths and emphasize that the cross section is a 
#         production cross section.
#       Added decay partial widths to the progress reports.
#       Updated final cs with final cs from event_mixer.
#0.54 : Changed "Estimating Cross Section" to "Calculating Cross
#         Section".
#       Changed decaySLHA1.txt to decaySLHA.txt.
#0.53 : Allowed allNew! as particle name.
#       Updated to use results/list_prc.txt for subprocess list.
#       Added widths in decaySLHA1.txt to event generation.
#         This is to enable the cross section to be updated with the
#         branching ratios of the decays.
#         This file is linked to Events/tmp where event_mixer works.
#         event_mixer needs to be updated now.
#       Updated progress to state "Done!" when 0 events are requested.
#         Just the cross section is being computed or just distributions
#         are being generated.
#0.52 : Fixed bug in cuts where J(u,u) would not be written since the script
#         only wrote nonidentical particles.  It appears that there is also
#         a problem in CH with identical particles here.  (When CH is fixed
#         I need to also fix this for cuts with 3 and 4 parameters.)
#         CH has been fixed.
#0.51 : Added photon pdfs.  Needs to be tested.
#       Added 1*x and 3*x to possible final states.  Needs to be tested.
#0.50 : Fixed bug where run parameters were not being written to the gnuplot
#         instruction file correctly.
#0.49 : Fixed a minor bug where the number of bins for the distribution was
#         not always being chosen correctly.
#0.48 : Passes user defined observable names (Uxxx) without modification.
#       Made more improvements to the distribution functionality.
#       Plots are automatically shown in numerical html.
#0.47 : Fixed bugs in distribution production.
#0.46 : Fixed bug in v0.45 where the {par} were being replaced in the wrong order.
#0.45 : Improved the cuts and distribution values to allow for run parameters
#         that are not part of the model.  This could be useful when calculating
#         the SM and want to place cuts that correspond with those set in
#         the new model calculation.  For example, if the new model has a Z',
#         then it may be convenient to set a cut on M(le,le) that depends on 
#         MZP.  This is straight forward in the new model, but in the SM, it 
#         was not possible.  Now, if run parameter are placed inside curly
#         brackets in the min or max values, they will be replaced with the value.
#         For example, Cut min: {MZP}/10, will be replaced with (1000)/10 if
#         the value of MZP is 1000.  Only the run parameters can be used in this
#         way.  The parameters of the model (including those in the run) can 
#         still be used directly and will not be replaced.  So,
#         Cut min: MZP/10 will remain MZP/10.
#0.44 : Updated script to work with 2.5.o.  Use -n switch to work with 2.5.n.
#       Cut and distribution names are determined on the fly.
#       Duplicates are removed.
#0.43 : Added basic 1 parameter distribution functionality.
#         Much still to be done on this.
#       Stopped the script after calculating the cross section if 0 events were
#         requested.
#       Made the html menu fixed, so that it does not scroll off the screen.
#         User needs to remove html/style.css to have this take effect.
#         This might not work in IE, but it does in Firefox.
#0.42 : Fixed 2.5.o issue where parantheses were ignored in cuts.
#0.41 : Improved specification of process for cuts etc.  Now, :n: means the nth
#         process and : means to apply it to all processes.
#0.40 : Fixed bug where it complained when it couldn't remove events_1.txt.
#         This happened when the cross section or decay rate was too small to produce
#         any events. 
#         (Thanks to Ismail Turan for pointing out the problem.)
#0.39 : Fixed problem with pbs server dropping jobs.  If a jobid of 0 is returned, 
#         the script simply reruns it.
#0.38 : Fixed bug in 0.37 improvement.
#0.37 : Improved the regexp identification of the cs during the cs estimation phase.
#0.36 : Added version number to header of run_batch.
#0.35 : Allowed real walltimes to be specified, thus allowing minutes.  E.g. a walltime of 
#         1.25 means 1hr 15min.
#0.34 : Fixed bug with determination of subprocesses.  Changed =~ to eq when comparing particle
#         strings.
#0.33 : Set the default Beamstrahlung parameters to be the same as in CH (~ILC).
#0.32 : Put the cross section in scientific notation in html and txt progress files.
#0.31 : Added ISR and Beam parameters to event file details.
#0.30 : Added ISR and Beamstrahlung for electron positron colliders.
#0.29 : Added cleanup parameter.  If set to True of Yes, the individual event files will
#         be removed after they are combined.
#       Updated batch details printed in combined events file.
#0.28 : Fixed bug where combine_events would get ahead of itself and think it was combining a
#         run parameter ahead of where it really was.
#0.27 : Fixed cosmetic bug where the number of events produced was incorrectly reported in html.
#         wc -l only gives an estimate.  Now, the final N events is taken from CH output.
#0.26 : Fixed bug where sometimes cuts, etc were not being renumbered correctly.
#0.25 : Fixed a bug with the pbs job_script files not being completed.
#       Fixed bug with numbering of process library directories.  Duplicates were being created.
#         New process numbers are now being created by finding the highest number used and adding one.
#0.24 : Added new nt_maker.  Now automatically splits nt's into 50K increments.
#     	 Improved the event library.
#     	 Commented out link to Batch Request.  (Was this really useful?  If so, I should update it.)
#0.23 : Incremented random number seed for each subprocess and decay.
#         Previously, the random seed was the same for all subprocesses and decays.
#         This caused strong correlations between diferrent decay modes and erroneous results.
#      Uppercased random number seed.
#      Padded beginning of random number seed with 1's instead of 0's.
#      Fixed maxN bug.  It was writing it as an integer.  Now, as a real.
#0.22 : Updated the vegas and generate events parameters in decays.
#         Previously, they were left at the default values.
#       Wrapped the number of events to produce in int().
#       niced event_mixer and nt_maker.
#0.21 : Added nice level specification to batch file.  Defaults to 19.
#       Added nt_maker if present.  (Creates nt on the fly.)
#0.20 : Fixed issue where the .a files were not being linked.
#       Also linked the EXTLIB and extern.h, although I don't know if
#         either was necessary.  (I don't see a difference in the results.)
#0.19 : Fixed issue with alphaPDF defaulting to 0.

		<h3>Running</h3>
		<p>
			The batch script can be run in two ways.  It can be run directly from the run_batch perl script located in the bin directory as in
			<table>
				<tr><td>bin/./run_batch batch_file</td></tr>
			</table>
			where batch_file is the file that contains the instructions for the batch script.  If this method is used, the environment variable \$CALCHEP must first be set which refers to the CalcHEP main directory.  The batch script can also be invoked with the calchep_batch shell script in the users directory as in
			<table>
				<tr><td>./calchep_batch batch_file</td></tr>
			</table>
			where, again, batch_file is the file that contains the instructions for the batch script.  The default calchep_batch shell script automatically sets the \$CALCHEP environment variable and then invokes run_batch from the bin directory.  As the batch script runs, it continuously updates these html files with the current progress of the batch.  The frequency of the updates can be set in the batch file with the key phrase <a href='parallelization.html'>"sleep time"</a>.

		<h1>Batch File Help</h1>
		<p>
			This script is designed to be used in batch mode.  All the information about the batch is included by the user in a batch file.  The batch file can be named anything the user likes and is specified as the first argument of the batch script.  Most of the information available in CalcHEP is available in the batch file.  We describe each section of the batch file in these help files.  You can access each one by clicking on the links to the left.

	<div id='help_main'>
		<h1>Model Help</h1>
		<h3>Model</h3>
		<p>
			The first section of the batch file should contain the specification of the model.  This is done by model name and should match exactly the name in the CalcHEP model list.  So, if you want to scan the \"Standard Model(CKM=1)\", you would specify this with the batch file line:<br>
			<table>
				<tr><td>Model</td><td>:</td><td>Standard Model(CKM=1)</td></tr>
			</table>
			There is no default for this line.  It must be included.
			<h3>Gauge</h3>
                </p>
		<p>
		The gauge of the calculation should also be specified in this section.  Choices are Feynman and unitary gauge.  CalcHEP is much better suited to calculation in Feynman gauge, but there may be times that unitary gauge is useful.  This can be specified using the keyword \"Gauge\" as in:<br>
			<table>
				<tr><td>Gauge</td><td>:</td><td>unitary</td></tr>
			</table>
			The default is Feynman.
		</p>
                <h3>Virtual W/Z Decays</h3>
               <p>
               CalcHEP allows decays of particle such as the Higgs to decay via off-shell W and Z bosons.  This behavior can be controled by the key phrase "Virtual W/Z decays" as in:
               <table>
                       <tr><td>Virtual W/Z decays : Off</td></tr>
               </table>
               The default is "On".
               </p>

sub print_help_process {
	print_help_batch_links("$html_dir/help/process.html");
	open(HTML_FILE, ">>$html_dir/help/process.html");
	print HTML_FILE <<ENDHTML;
	<div id='help_main'>
		<h1>Process Help</h1>
		<h3>Process</h3>
		<p>
			Processes are specified using the \"Process\" keyword and standard CalcHEP notation as in:<br>
			<table>
				<tr><td>Process</td><td>:</td><td>p,p->j,l,l</td></tr>
			</table>
			Multiple processes can also be specified as in:<br>
			<table>
				<tr><td>Process</td><td>:</td><td>p,p->E,ne</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Process</td><td>:</td><td>p,p->M,nm</td></tr>
			</table>
			As many processes as desired can be specified.  When more than one process is specified, the processes are numbered by the order in which they are specified in the batch file.  So, in this example, p,p->E,ne is process 1 and p,p->M,nm is process 2.  This numbering can be useful when specifying <a href='qcd.html'>QCD scale</a>, <a href='cuts.html'>cuts</a>, <a href='kinematics.html'>kinematics</a>, <a href='regularization.html'>regularization</a> and <a href='distributions.html'>distributions</a> allowing these to be specified separately for each process.  There is no default for this keyword.  It must be specified.
		</p>
		<h3>Decay</h3>
		<p>
			Decays are specified using the \"Decay\" keyword and are also in standard CalcHEP notation as in:<br>
			<table>
				<tr><td>Decay</td><td>:</td><td>W->l,nu</td></tr>
			</table>
			Again, multiple decays can be specified as in:<br>
			<table>
				<tr><td>Decay</td><td>:</td><td>W->l,nu</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Decay</td><td>:</td><td>Z->l,l</td></tr>
			</table>
			The default is to not have any decays.  <a href='cuts.html'>Cuts</a> and <a href='distributions.html'>distributions</a> do not apply to decays, however, <a href='kinematics.html'>kinematics</a>, and <a href='regularization.html'>regularization</a> do.
		</p>
		<h3>Alias</h3>
		<p>
			It is sometimes convenient to specify groups of particles as in the particles that compose the proton or all the leptons.  This can be done with the keyword \"Alias\" as in:<br>
			<table>
				<tr><td>Alias</td><td>:</td><td>p=u,d,U,D,G</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Alias</td><td>:</td><td>l=e,E,m,M</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Alias</td><td>:</td><td>nu=ne,Ne,nm,Nm</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Alias</td><td>:</td><td>W=W+,W-</td></tr>
			</table>
			As many composite particles as necessary can be specified.  These definitions can be used in <a href='cuts.html'>cuts</a> and <a href='distributions.html'>distributions</a> as well as in the processes and decays.  The default is not to have any composite definitions.
			
		</p>
		<h3>Remove</h3>
		<p>
			It is sometimes necessary to remove particles from internal lines of the diagrams. This can be done with the keyword \"Remove\" as in:<br>
			<table>
				<tr><td>Remove</td><td>:</td><td>W+>2,Z</td></tr>
			</table>
			The notation is the same as in the graphical interface and is used in the symbolic session of productions processes directly without any modifications.  For decays, the keyword is \"Remove Decay\" as in:<br>
                        <table>
				<tr><td>Remove Decay</td><td>:</td><td>Z,H</td></tr>
			</table>
                        Aliases can not be used in Remove statements.  We would like to stress that the user should use these keywords with great care as violation of gauge invariance could occur ruining important cancellations between diagrams.

		<h1>PDF Help</h1>
		<h3>PDF</h3>
		<p>
			The PDF of a proton or antiproton can be specified with the \"pdf1\" and \"pdf2\" kewords which correspond to the pdfs of the first and second incoming particles respectively.  Choices for these keywords are:<br>
			<table>
				<tr><td>cteq6l (anti-proton)    </td></tr>
		   	<tr><td>cteq6l (proton)         </td></tr>

    			<tr><td>None                    </td></tr>

    			<tr><td>pdf1</td><td>:</td><td>cteq6l (proton)</td></tr>
    			<tr><td>pdf2</td><td>:</td><td>cteq6l (proton)</td></tr>
    		</table>
    		The default is none.  These keywords can also be used for electron positron colliders.  For this process the available pdfs are:<br>
    		<table>
    			<tr><td>ISR                     </td></tr>
    			<tr><td>ISR & Beamstrahlung     </td></tr>

    			<tr><td>Laser photons           </td></tr>
    			<tr><td>None                    </td></tr>
    		</table>
    		The following proton electron collider pdf is also available:<br>
    		<table>
    			<tr><td>Proton Photon           </td></tr>
    		</table>
    		All of these pdfs must be typed exactly or copied into the batch file.  
		</p>
		<h3>Bunch Specification</h3>
		<p>
			If \"ISR & Beam\" is chosen, then the following beam parameters may be specified:<br>
    		<table>
    			<tr><td>Bunch x+y sizes (nm)</td><td>:</td><td>550</td></tr>
    			<tr><td>Bunch length (mm)</td><td>:</td><td>0.45</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Number of particles</td><td>:</td><td>2.1E+10</td></tr>
			</table>
    		The default values are the default values in CalcHEP and correspond roughly with the ILC.
    	</p>
		<h3>Equiv. Photon</h3>
		<p>
			If \"Equiv. Photon\" is chosen for the pdf, then the following parameters may be specified:<br>
			<table>
				<tr><td>Photon particle</td><td>:</td><td>e^-</td></tr>
				<tr><td>|Q|max</td><td>:</td><td>150</td></tr>
			</table>
			Choices for the \"Photon particle\" keyphrase are mu^-, e^-, e^+, mu^+.  The default is e^+.  The default for the keyword \"|Q|max\" is the same as in CalcHEP.
		</p>
		<h3>Proton Photon</h3>
		<p>
			If \"Proton Photon\" is chosen then the following may be specified:<br>
			<table>
				<tr><td>Incoming particle mass</td><td>:</td><td>0.937</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Incoming particle charge</td><td>:</td><td>-1</td></tr>
				<tr><td>|Q^2|max</td><td>:</td><td>2.1</td></tr>

			The parameters of the model are taken from the varsN.mdl file in the models directory.  Other parameter values can be used if specified using the \"Parameter\" keyword.  Here is an example:<br>
			<table>
				<tr><td>Parameter</td><td>:</td><td>EE=0.31</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Parameter</td><td>:</td><td>SW=0.481</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Parameter</td><td>:</td><td>MZ=91.1884</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Parameter</td><td>:</td><td>wW=2.08895</td></tr>
			</table>
			Any parameters not specified using this keyword in the batch file will be taken from the varsN.mdl file in the models directory.  This gives a convenient way of changing the default values of the parameters.  Simply open CalcHEP in symbolic mode, choose to edit the model and change the values of the indepenedent parameters.  These new values will then become the default values used by this batch program.  There is no need to redo the process library.

		<h1>Scan Help</h1>
		<h3>Scans</h3>
		<p>
			In some models it is useful to scan over a parameter such as the mass of one of the new particles.  For example, if there is a new W' gauge boson, it may be desireable to generate events and/or distributions for a range of masses for the W'.  This can be done with the \"Scan parameter\", \"Scan begin\", \"Scan step size\" and \"Scan n steps\" keyphrases.  Here is an example:<br>
			<table>
				<tr><td>Scan parameter</td><td>:</td><td>MWP</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Scan begin</td><td>:</td><td>400</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Scan step size</td><td>:</td><td>50</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Scan n steps</td><td>:</td><td>17</td></tr>
			</table>
			This will generate the events and/or distributions for the model with the mass of the W' set to 400GeV, 450GeV, 500GeV,...1200GeV.  As many scans as desired can be specified (including zero).  For each scan, all four keyphrases have to be specified.  Furthermore, if there is more than one scan, all four keyphrases have to be specified together.  Here is an example with two scans:<br>
			<table>
				<tr><td>Sccan parameter</td><td>:</td><td>MWP</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Scan begin</td><td>:</td><td>400</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Scan step size</td><td>:</td><td>50</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Scan n steps</td><td>:</td><td>17</td></tr>
				<tr><td></td></tr>
				<tr><td>Scan parameter</td><td>:</td><td>MF</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Scan begin</td><td>:</td><td>2000</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Scan step size</td><td>:</td><td>200</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Scan n steps</td><td>:</td><td>11</td></tr>
			</table>
			This example will scan over both parameters MWP and MF.

		<p>
			The parameters of the QCD menu of the numerical session can be specified as in the following example:<br>
			<table>
				<tr><td>parton dist. alpha</td><td>:</td><td>ON</td></tr>
				<tr><td>alpha(MZ)</td><td>:</td><td>0.118</td></tr>
				<tr><td>alpha nf</td><td>:</td><td>5</td></tr>
				<tr><td>alpha order</td><td>:</td><td>NLO</td></tr>
				<tr><td>mb(mb)</td><td>:</td><td>4</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Mtop(pole)</td><td>:</td><td>174</td></tr>
				<tr><td>alpha Q</td><td>:</td><td>M45</td></tr>
			</table>
			The default values are the ones in CalcHEP itself.  Not all the keywords have to be included in the batch file.  It is sufficient to include the ones that need to be changed.  For example, if only the QCD scale needs to be changed, it can be specified as:<br>
			<table>
				<tr><td>alpha Q</td><td>:</td><td>Mt/2</td></tr>
			</table>
			The QCD scale can be specified in terms of the invariant mass of certain final state particles as in \"Mij\" which means that the QCD scale is taken to be the invariant mass of particles i and j.  Or, it can be specified as a formula in terms of the parameters of the model as in \"Mt/2\" which means half of the top quark mass.  When specifying the scale in terms of the invariant mass of final state particles, the numbers are taken from the way the processes are entered with the \"Process\" keyword.  So, if the process is specified as \"p,p->j,l,n\", \"M45\" means the invariant mass of the lepton and neutrino (l,n).  The batch script will take care of renumbering if the subprocesses have the final state particles in a different order.  It is also sometimes useful to use a different scale for different processes.  For example, suppose the two processes \"p,p->j,l,n\" and \"p,p->j,j,l,n\" are specified in the batch file, the scales could be specified as in this example:<br>
			<table>
				<tr><td>alpha Q</td><td>:1:</td><td>M45</td></tr>
				<tr><td>alpha Q</td><td>:2:</td><td>M56</td></tr>
			</table>
			The number between the :: specifies which process to apply this scale and corresponds to the order in which the user specified the processes.  If more than one process is specified, but the same non default scale is desired for all of them, this can be specified as in:<br>
			<table>
				<tr><td>alpha Q</td><td>:</td><td>Mt/2</td></tr>
			</table>
			This specification will apply the same scale \"Mt/2\" to all processes.
		</p>
                <p>
                        The key phrase "alpha Q" will apply the same scale to the couplings and to the parton distribution functions.  If, however, the user would like to apply different scales to the couplings and the parton distribution functions, he or she should use the key phrases "alpha Fact Q" for the parton distribution functions and "alpha Ren Q" for the renormalization scale for the couplings.  For example,
                        <table>
				<tr><td>alpha Fact Q</td><td>:</td><td>Mt/2</td></tr>
				<tr><td>alpha Ren Q</td><td>:</td><td>MZ</td></tr>
			</table>
                        which specifies that the parton distribution scale should be half the top quark mass and the renormalization scale should be the Z boson mass.  Individual processes can be given different factorization and renormalization scales using the :N: notation (where N is the process).  The default is "M12".  If "alpha Q" is used in the batch file, it takes precedence over "alpha Fact Q" and "alpha Ren Q".  Either "alpha Q" should be used or "alpha Fact Q" and "alpha Ren Q", but not both.

		<h3>Cut</h3>
		<p>
			Cuts are specified with the keywords \"Cut parameter\", \"Cut invert\", \"Cut min\" and \"Cut max\" and use standard CalcHEP notation, except for \"Cut invert\" which can be either \"True\" or \"False\".  These cuts are only applied to the production processes.  They are not applied to the products of the decays.  Here is an example:<br>
			<table>
				<tr><td>Cut parameter</td><td>:</td><td>T(le)</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Cut invert</td><td>:</td><td>False</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Cut min</td><td>:</td><td>20</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Cut max</td><td>:</td><td></td></tr>
			</table>
			For each cut, all four keyphrases have to be present.  As many cuts as desired can be included.  Including \"Cut min\" or \"Cut max\" but leaving the value blank will leave the value blank in the CalcHEP table.  If the cut should only be applied to a certain process, then the colon can be changed to :n: where n is the process.  So, for example, we could do:<br>
			<table>
				<tr><td>Cut parameter</td><td>:</td><td>T(l)</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Cut invert</td><td>:</td><td>True</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Cut min</td><td>:</td><td></td></tr>
				<tr><td>Cut max</td><td>:</td><td>20</td></tr>
				<tr><td></td></tr>
				<tr><td>Cut parameter</td><td>:</td><td>T(j)</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Cut invert</td><td>:</td><td>False</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Cut min</td><td>:</td><td>20</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Cut max</td><td>:</td><td></td></tr>
				<tr><td></td></tr>
				<tr><td>Cut parameter</td><td>:2:</td><td>J(j,j)</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Cut invert</td><td>:</td><td>False</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Cut min</td><td>:2:</td><td>0.4</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Cut max</td><td>:2:</td><td></td></tr>
				</table>
			This set of cuts will apply a p<sub>T</sub> cut to leptons and jets in all processes but a jet cone angle cut only to process 2.  The numbering of the processes corresponds to the order in which the processes are entered in the batch file.  Alias particle names can be used as long as they are defined by the keyword \"Alias\" in the process section.  Note that both of the transverse mass cuts apply a p<sub>T</sub>>20GeV cut in this example.

		<h3>Kinematics</h3>
		<p>
			As the number of final state particles increases, it can be very helpful to specify the \"kinematics\" which helps CalcHEP in the numerical integration stage.  This is done in exactly the same notation as in CalcHEP.  The numbering corresponds to the order the particles are entered in the process in the batch file.  Here is an example:<br>

			</table>
			If multiple processes are specified, using a single colon as in the previous example will apply the kinematics to all processes.  If different kinematics is desired for each process, then the :n: notation can be used as in:<br>
			<table>
				<tr><td>Kinematics</td><td>:1:</td><td>12 -> 34 , 56</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Kinematics</td><td>:1:</td><td>34 -> 3 , 4</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Kinematics</td><td>:1:</td><td>56 -> 5 , 6</td></tr>

		<h1>Distribution Help</h1>
		<h3>Distributions</h3>
		<p>
			The ability to do distributions is still somewhat experimental so they should be checked carefully.  Distributions are only applied to the production process.  The decays are ignored.  Standard CalcHEP notation is used for the distribution parameter.  Here is an example:<br>
			<table>
				<tr><td>Dist parameter</td><td>:</td><td>M(e,E)</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Dist min</td><td>:</td><td>0</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Dist max</td><td>:</td><td>200</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Dist n bins</td><td>:</td><td>100</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Dist title</td><td>:</td><td>p,p->l,l</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Dist x-title</td><td>:</td><td>M(l,l) (GeV)</td></tr>
			</table>
			The value for the keyphrase \"Dist n bins\" has to be one of:<br>
			<table>
				<tr><td>300</td><td>150</td><td>100</td><td>75</td><td>60</td><td>50</td></tr>
				<tr><td>30</td><td>25</td><td>20</td><td>15</td><td>12</td><td>10</td></tr>
				<tr><td>6</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>2</td></tr>
			</table>
			These are the values allowed by the CalcHEP histogram routines.  The values given for the titles have to be pure text.  No special characters are currently allowed.  Gnuplot must be installed for plots to be produced on the fly and included in the html progress reports.  More than one distribution can be specified, however each distribution must be unambiguous and apply in exactly one way for each subprocess.  Also, distributions will work even if no events are requested.
		</p>
		<h3>Possible Issues</h3>
		<p>
		For this to work, the distributions have to be unambiguous and apply to all subprocesses the same way.  For example, if a process is p,p->l,l,l and the distribution M(l,l) is given, then this routine will not know which two leptons to apply the distribution to and the results are unpredictable.  If the process is p,p->l,l where l=e,E,m,M and the distribution M(e,E) is desired, this distribution will only apply to some of the subprocesses and give unpredictable results.  Make sure your distribution is unambiguous and applies in exactly one way to each subprocess.  If this is done, it should work.  Nevertheless, check each distribution carefully to make sure it is being done correctly.

		<h3>Number of events</h3>
		<p>
			The number of events is specified with the keyphrase \"Number of events\".  This specifies the number of events to produce after all subprocesses are combined and decayed.  If a run over a parameter is specified, this keyphrase determines the number of events to produce for each value of the run parameter.  The number of events requested can be zero.

		<h1>Parallelization Help</h1>
		<h3>Parallelization Method</h3>
		<p>
			The parallelization mode is set using the keyphrase \"Parallelization method\" and can be either \"local\", \"pbs\" or \"lsf\".  In local mode, the jobs run on the local computer while in pbs mode, the jobs are run on a pbs cluster.  If run from a pbs or lsf cluster, the terminal should be on the computer with the pbs or lsf queue.  Here is an example of setting the batch to run in pbs mode:<br>
			<table>
				<tr><td>Parallelization mode</td><td>:</td><td>pbs</td></tr>
			</table>
			Local mode is the default.
		</p>
		<h3>PBS</h3>
		<p>
		If run in pbs mode, there are several options that may be necessary for the pbs cluster.  All of them can be left blank in which case they will not be given to the pbs cluster.  Here is an example of the options available:<br>
		<table>
			<tr><td>Que</td><td>:</td><td>brody</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Walltime</td><td>:</td><td>1.5</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Memory</td><td>:</td><td>1</td></tr>
			<tr><td>email</td><td>:</td><td>name\@address</td></tr>
		</table>
		The que specifies which pbs que to  submit the jobs to.  Walltime specifies the maximum time (in hours) the job can run for.  If this time is exceeded, the jobs are killed by the pbs cluster.  Memory specifies the maximum amount of memory (in G) that the jobs can use.  If this memory is exceeded by a job, the pbs cluster will kill the job.  email specifies which email to send a message to if the job terminates prematurely.  The default for all of these is whatever is the default on the pbs cluster.
		</p>
		<h3>LSF</h3>
		<p>
		If run in lsf mode, there are several options that may be necessary for the lsf cluster.  All of them can be left blank in which case they will not be given to the lsf cluster.  Here is an example of the options available:<br>
		<table>
			<tr><td>Que</td><td>:</td><td>brody</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Walltime</td><td>:</td><td>1.5</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Memory</td><td>:</td><td>1</td></tr>
			<tr><td>email</td><td>:</td><td>name\@address</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>Project</td><td>:</td><td>project_name</td></tr>
		</table>
		The que specifies which lsf que to  submit the jobs to.  Walltime specifies the maximum time (in hours) the job can run for.  If this time is exceeded, the jobs are killed by the lsf cluster.  Memory specifies the maximum amount of memory (in G) that the jobs can use.  If this memory is exceeded by a job, the lsf cluster will kill the job.  email specifies which email to send any messages t.  The default for all of these is whatever is the default on the lsf cluster.
		</p>
		<h3>Sleep Time</h3>
		<p>
		Sleep time specifies the amount of time (in seconds) the batch script waits before checking which jobs are done and updating the html progress reports.  If a very short test run is being done, then this should be low (say a few seconds).  However, if the job is very large and will take severl hours or days, this should be set very high (say minutes or tens of minutes).  This will reduce the amount of cpu time the batch program uses.  Here is an example setting the sleep time to 1 minute:<br>
		<table>
			<tr><td>sleep time</td><td>:</td><td>60</td></tr>
		</table>
		The default is 3 seconds.
		</p>
		<h3>Nice Level</h3>
		<p>
			When jobs are run on the local computer, this specifies what nice level the jobs should be run at.  If other users are using the same computer, this allows the job to be put into the background and run at lower priority so as not to disturb the other users.  This should be between 0 and 19 where 19 is the lowest priority and the nicest.  Typically, it should be run at level 19 unless the user is sure it will not disturb anyone.  The nice level should be set both for a local computer and for a pbs batch run.  The reason is that some jobs are run on the pbs queue computer even on the pbs cluster.  Here is an example:<br>
			<table>
				<tr><td>Nice level</td><td>:</td><td>19</td></tr>
			</table>
			Level 19 is the default.

		<h1>Process Library Help</h1>

			After the numerical code is generated for a process, it is stored in the \"Process Library\".  If the same process is used later, it is first looked for in the process library.  If it is there, the symbolic session is skipped and it is used again in the numerical stage.  This can save significant time.

			After the events and/or distributions are generated, they are stored in the Events directory.  The prefix of the files is the name specified in the batch file plus either "-single" if no runs were specified or a string specifying the run parameter values if one or more runs are specified.  We will assume this is filename in the following.  If events are requested, they will be stored in the files<br>
			<table>
				<tr><td>filename.lhe</td></tr>
				<tr><td>filename.nt</td></tr>
			</table>
			where filename.lhe is the event file in Les Houches format and filename.nt is in PAW ntuple format.  The ntuple file is only created if the keyword "NTuple" is set to true and nt_maker is present in the bin directory.  If distributions are requested, they will be  stored in the files<br>
			<table>
				<tr><td>filename.distr</td></tr>
				<tr><td>filename_1.png</td></tr>
				<tr><td>filename_2.png</td></tr>
				<tr><td>...</td></tr>
			</table>
			  where filename.distr is the raw distribution data and can be read by "show_distr" in the bin directory.  The distributions generated on the fly by the batch script are stored in the files ending in ".png".
