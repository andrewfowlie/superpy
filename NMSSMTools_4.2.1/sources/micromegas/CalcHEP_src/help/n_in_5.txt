 The enter of value of helicity of the first incoming particle.
 This option is available if process in symbolic session was 
 specified in the corresponding manner with the % symbol after 
 particle name. Note that helicity is defined as a projection 
 of spin on the direction of motion. So,the input value is 
 restricted by +/- particle spin.
