     This directory contains  source files  of  some auxiliary  routines.
===========================================================================
1. axodraw.sty  - axodraw style file for LaTeX output produced by CalcHEP
==========================================================================
2. cteq2pdt.c  - transforms CTEQ *.tbl tables in CalcHEP *.pdt format. 
It has to be compiled by 
    cc -o cteq2pdt cteq2pdt.c alpha.c -lm 
the alpha.h file is used at compilation.
The usage:
   ./cteq2pdt <cteq_file.tbl >calchep_file.pdt
Can be applied to CTEQ4,CTEQ5,CTEQ6 files.
==========================================================================
3. mrst2pdt.c -transforms MRST *.dat tables in CalcHEP *.pdt format.
It has to be compiled by 
    cc -o mrst2pdt mrst2pdt.c alpha.c -lm 
the alpha.h file is used at compilation.
The usage:
   ./mrts2pdt name [nf Odr alMZ] <mrst_file.dat >calchep_file.pdt
Can be applied to mrst2002 files. 
MRST '.dat' file doesn't contains information about running alpha. 
It can  be passed via addition parameters: nf,Odr,alMZ. See MRST documentation.
(Indeed nf=5, Ord has to  be 'lo', 'nlo','nnlo' is included in filename) 
========================================================================== 
4. checkpdt.c  is a simple program for testing *pdt files.
It can be compiled by 
 cc  -o checkpdt checkpdt.c pdt.c -lm
where pdt.c has to be copied from c_sources/num together with 
c_sources/num/include/pdt.h  
The usage:
   ./checkpdt file.pdt parton x q 
where parton has to be presented by PDG numerical code.  
It writes on the screen parton density  dN/dx and alpha(q)
==========================================================================
5. main_22.c - is an example of 'main' program that generates and uses  CalcHEP 
c-code output. Use $CALCHEP/main/make_main to compile it. 
==========================================================================
6.  
sum_22.m sum_22.red sum_cd.m sum_cd.red sum_int.m sum_int.red sum_num.red -

Mathematica and Reduce programs to work with symbolic formulae for diagrams.
See manual.   
==========================================================================
7.
 check.red cmp.red cycle_check cycle_cmp -
 Auxiliary programs which allow to check symbolic calculator of CalcHEP.
==========================================================================
